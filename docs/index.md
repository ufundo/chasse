The concept is that each contact can be at a particular stage of one of a set of
journeys. So you might have a journey for new people to your email list, and a
journey for first time donors and a journey for regular givers.

A "journey" is here simply means they'll get sent a series of emails as they
"step" forward. Or <em>chassé</em> across!

The system can be **automated** so that people bump along without you clicking anything.
